# Shopping List
This is a full-stack CRUD app which is able to send, receive, update, and delete data created in the UI and then
pushed to the database. It is able to display items you've created in the UI and you can remove them by clicking the red 'X'
after you no longer need it.

# Motivation
This project challenged me to learn new technologies which included: NodeJS, Express and MongoDB. I enjoyed learning the MERN
stack and I would definitely make apps utilizing that stack in the future.
